# Empty Babel Project

## Motivation

Starter Pack for framework A and framework B Is Good
But what if what you need is just an empty babel project that
you can fill in the blank yourself with already neccessary command added

## Included command

#### Start

`npm run start` => `build and run the babel`

#### Dev

`npm run dev` => `run the src folder with auto refresh from nodemon`
